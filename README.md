###(Bonus Laravel integration supported!!)

**[TPLink Smartplug](https://github.com/jonnywilliamson/tplinksmartplug) is a small PHP library that allows anyone to control and access a TPLink Smartplug.** 

Current TPLINK models supported are
 - [HS110](http://uk.tp-link.com/products/details/cat-5258_HS110.html)
 - [HS100](http://uk.tp-link.com/products/details/cat-5258_HS100.html)
 
It is likely that other TPLink models will also work, but these have not been checked.

## Installation
This package can be installed standalone in a regular PHP project, or can also be integrated into Laravel to make life even easier.

To install the latest version simply use composer to add it to your project using the following command:

```
composer require williamson/tplinksmartplug
```

### Laravel Installation/Integration

Once the TPLink Smartplug library is installed, you need to register the library's service provider, in `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => array(
    //...
    Williamson\TPLinkSmartplug\Laravel\TPLinkServiceProvider::class,
)
```
##### Facades

By default, this library will *automatically* register a facade to be used in Laravel. The package checks first to ensure `TPLink` has not already be registered and if this is the case, will register `TPLink` as your quick access to the library. More examples to follow.

##### Config file
This package requires a config file so that you can provide the address/details of the TPLink devices you would like to control. To generate this file, run the following command: 
```
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider='Williamson\TPLinkSmartplug\Laravel\TPLinkServiceProvider'
```
This will create a `TPLink.php` file in your Laravel `config` folder. You should edit this to setup your devices.

## Configuration
The config file is a very simple array structured file. A config file is required for both standalone/Laravel projects. The content is similar to this:

```php
//TPLink.php

<?php
return [
    'lamp' => [
        'ip'   => '192.168.1.100', //Or hostname eg: home.example.com
        'port' => '9999',
        'timeout' => 5 // Optional, timeout setting (how long we will try communicate with device before giving up)
    ],
];
```

You may add as many devices as you wish, as long as you specify the IP address (or host address if required) and port number to access each one. Giving each device a name makes it easy to identify them when coding later. _(Please note that the name you give here does NOT have to match the actual name you might have assigned the device using an official app like Kasa. They do NOT have to match)

You can use the `autoDiscoverTPLinkDevices` method to automatically find networked devices.

## Usage
You can access your device either through the `TPLinkManager` class (especially useful if you have multiple devices), or directly using the `TPLinkDevice` class.

Using the manager, allows you to specify *WHICH* device you would like to send your command to.

If you only have one device you *may* just want to use the `TPDevice` class by itself - but using the manager is recommended.

Depending on your style of coding you may use either the Facade or instantiate the object yourself.

The following are all similar:
```php

//Non laravel
    $tpManager = new TPLinkManager($configArray);
    $tpDevice = $tpManager->device('lamp')

//Laravel
    //with facade
    TPLink::device('lamp')
    
    //without facade
    $tpDevice = app('tplink')->device('lamp');
    $tpDevice = app(TPLinkManager::class)->device('lamp');

```

Once you have your device ready, you can then send it a command.

#### Commands
All commands for the smartplug have been created in a separate class to ease use and allow for more to be added easily in the future.
 
To send a command, simply call the `sendCommand` method on the `TPDevice` object and pass in the command required as a parameter.

For example, to get the current status of the smartplug  
```php
//Non laravel
    
    $tpDevice->sendCommand(TPLinkCommand::systemInfo());


//Laravel
    //with facade
    TPLink::device('lamp')->sendCommand(TPLinkCommand::systemInfo());
    
    //without facade
    $tpDevice->sendCommand(TPLinkCommand::systemInfo());

```

If a command requires a parameter, provide that as well:

```php
//Non laravel
    
    $tpDevice->sendCommand(TPLinkCommand::setLED(false));


//Laravel
    //with facade
    TPLink::device('lamp')->sendCommand(TPLinkCommand::setLED(false));
    
    //without facade
    $tpDevice->sendCommand(TPLinkCommand::setLED(false));
```

#### Auto Discovery
You can search your local network for devices using `TPLinkManager`, using the method `autoDiscoverTPLinkDevices` 
all found devices will be added to the 'TPLinkManager' config automatically, exposed using `deviceList()`.

You must provide the IP range you wish to scan, use it as follows: 
```php
//Non laravel
    $tpLinkManager->autoDiscoverTPLinkDevices('192.168.0.*');

//Laravel
    // with facade
    TPLink::autoDiscoverTPLinkDevices('192.168.0.*');
    
    // without facade
    app('tplink')->autoDiscoverTPLinkDevices('192.168.0.*');
    app(TPLinkManager::class)->autoDiscoverTPLinkDevices('192.168.0.*');
```

The auto discovery command will take a while to scan, once completed you can use `deviceList()` method to view the new configuration and any found devices.

#### Toggle Power
There is one command that is called directly on the `TPLinkDevice` and that is the `togglePower()` method.

If you only wish to toggle the current power state of the plug, use it as follows: 
```php
//Non laravel
    
    $tpDevice->togglePower();


//Laravel
    //with facade
    TPLink::device('lamp')->togglePower();
    
    //without facade
    $tpDevice->togglePower();
```


There are a large number of commands in the `TPLinkCommand` class. Please read the docblock comments for explanations and requirements for each one.
 
The current list of commands available to use are:
 ```
 systemInfo
 powerOn
