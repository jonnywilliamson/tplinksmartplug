###(Bonus Laravel integration supported!!)

**[TPLink Smartplug](https://github.com/jonnywilliamson/tplinksmartplug) is a small PHP library that allows anyone to control and access a TPLink Smartplug.** 

Current TPLINK models supported are
 - [HS110](http://uk.tp-link.com/products/details/cat-5258_HS110.html)
 - [HS100](http://uk.tp-link.com/products/details/cat-5258_HS100.html)
 
It is likely that other TPLink models will also work, but these have not been checked.

## Installation
This package can be installed standalone in a regular PHP project, or can also be integrated into Laravel to make life even easier.

To install the latest version simply use composer to add it to your project using the following command:

```
composer require williamson/tplinksmartplug
```

### Laravel Installation/Integration

This library supports Laravel's auto discovery feature for auto registering the service provider and facade. If your version of Laravel supports auto discovery, after you have added this package YOU ARE NOW DONE! 

If you are using a very old version of Laravel, once this package is installed, you need to register the package's service provider, in `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    //...
    Williamson\TPLinkSmartplug\Laravel\TPLinkServiceProvider::class,
]
```
##### Facades

Only if your version of Laravel does NOT support auto discovery then add the following to the aliases section of 'app.php'.
```php
'aliases' => [
    //...
    "TPLink" => Williamson\TPLinkSmartplug\Laravel\Facades\TPLinkFacade::class
]
```

##### Config file
This package requires a config file so that you can provide the address/details of the TPLink devices you would like to control. To generate this file, run the following command: 
```
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider='Williamson\TPLinkSmartplug\Laravel\TPLinkServiceProvider'
```
This will create a `TPLink.php` file in your Laravel `config` folder. You should edit this to setup your devices.

## Configuration
The config file is a very simple array structured file. A config file is required for both standalone/Laravel projects. The content is similar to this:

```php
//TPLink.php

<?php
return [
    'lamp' => [
        'ip'   => '192.168.1.100', //Or hostname eg: home.example.com
        'port' => '9999',
    ],
];
```

You may add as many devices as you wish, as long as you specify the IP address (or host address if required) and port number to access each one. Giving each device a name makes it easy to identify them when coding later. _(Please note that the name you give here does NOT have to match the actual name you might have assigned the device using an official app like Kasa. They do NOT have to match)_

## Usage
You can access your device either through the `TPLinkManager` class (especially useful if you have multiple devices), or directly using the `TPLinkDevice` class.

Using the manager, allows you to specify *WHICH* device you would like to send your command to.

If you only have one device you *may* just want to use the `TPDevice` class by itself - but using the manager is recommended.

Depending on your style of coding you may use either the Facade or instantiate the object yourself.

The following are all similar:
```php

//Non laravel
    $tpManager = new TPLinkManager($configArray);
    $tpDevice = $tpManager->device('lamp')

//Laravel
    //with facade
    TPLink::device('lamp')
    
    //without facade
    $tpDevice = app('tplink')->device('lamp');
    $tpDevice = app(TPLinkManager::class)->device('lamp');

```

Once you have your device ready, you can then send it a command.

#### Commands
All commands for the smartplug have been created in a separate class to ease use and allow for more to be added easily in the future.
 
To send a command, simply call the `sendCommand` method on the `TPDevice` object and pass in the command required as a parameter.

For example, to get the current status of the smartplug  
```php
//Non laravel
    
    $tpDevice->sendCommand(TPLinkCommand::systemInfo());


//Laravel
    //with facade
    TPLink::device('lamp')->sendCommand(TPLinkCommand::systemInfo());
    
    //without facade
    $tpDevice->sendCommand(TPLinkCommand::systemInfo());

```

If a command requires a parameter, provide that as well:

```php
//Non laravel
    
    $tpDevice->sendCommand(TPLinkCommand::setLED(false));


//Laravel
    //with facade
    TPLink::device('lamp')->sendCommand(TPLinkCommand::setLED(false));
    
    //without facade
    $tpDevice->sendCommand(TPLinkCommand::setLED(false));
```

####Toggle Power
There is one command that is called directly on the `TPLinkDevice` and that is the `togglePower()` method.

If you only wish to toggle the current power state of the plug, use it as follows: 
```php
//Non laravel
    
    $tpDevice->togglePower();


//Laravel
    //with facade
    TPLink::device('lamp')->togglePower();
    
    //without facade
    $tpDevice->togglePower();
```


There are a large number of commands in the `TPLinkCommand` class. Please read the docblock comments for explanations and requirements for each one.
 
The current list of commands available to use are:
 ```
 systemInfo
 powerOn
 powerOff
 setLED
